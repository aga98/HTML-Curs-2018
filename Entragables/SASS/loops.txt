You can make loops and conditionals in Sass. Which situations require this functionalities? 
Write some code as example.


The @if Directive
The first directive we’ll talk about is @if, which takes an expression, 
evaluates it as true or false, and based on the evaluation runs or doesn’t run some code. 
It allows you to create different branches in your code that run under different conditions.

Here’s an example where I change the color of an h1 based on the color of the body background.

$body: blue;
h1 {  
  @if $body == red {  
	color: cyan;  
  } @else if $body == green {  
	color: magenta;  
  } @else if $body == blue {  
	color: yellow;  
  } @else {  
	color: black;  
  }
}


The @for Directive
The @for directive sets a counter and loops through 
a block of code as long as the counter falls within the specified bounds you set.




@for <$variable> from <start> through <end> { 

}

The first time through the @for loop, the value of $variable will be <start>. 
The next time through the loop the value will be <start> + 1. 
The time after it will be <start> + 2 and so on until such a time when the 
value of $variable equals <end> in which case your code will run one last time 
and then move on to whatever code follows the loop.


The second option is:
@for $var from <start> to <end> {

} 
which starts at <start> and loops through each iteration "to" <end> and stops. 
Once the directive hits the <end> it stops the looping process and does 
not evaluate the loop that one last time.
