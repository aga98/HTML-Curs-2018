What is the use of the @content directive in mixins? Give an example.


Through the @content directive you are also able to pass a block of styles not defined in the mixin. These additional styles will appear within the mixin where you place @content:

@mixin cont {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  @content;
}

Now, when you call this mixin, you will be able to add any additional properties youâ€™d like to use:

div {
  @include cont {
    font-size: 12px;
    font-style: italic;
  }
}

div {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-style: italic;
}
