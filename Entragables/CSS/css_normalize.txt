Normalize is a CSS file whose main objective is to maintain 
similar styles in browsers,  since each one adds its own styles by default, 
as different paddings, margins, font-sizes, etc. 
With Normalize CSS styles are regularized, so our website looks the same 
regardless of the browser where it is displayed. 
It is also ready to fully adapt to HTML5.
