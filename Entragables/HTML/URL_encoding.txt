In a website we can set its charset to define the character encoding of the letters
we will use (for example, for chinese the charset is "utf-8",
that is pretty universal, but for catalan it is "ISO-8859-1").

Nevertheless, sometimes we will find strange numbers
instead of letters in text or URLs. It is called URL Encoding.
Search info about URL Encoding/Decoding and write
the encoded version of this characters:

- space --> +
- á --> %C3%A1
- è --> %C3%A8
- ö --> %C3%B6
- < --> %3C
- ) --> %29
